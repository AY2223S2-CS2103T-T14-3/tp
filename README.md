## About InternBuddy
InternBuddy provides a 1-stop platform for **Computing undergraduates** to manage and track their internship applications.
It is optimized for **typing** which Computing undergraduates are comfortable and proficient in, allowing them to fully and
efficiently exploit the applicationâ€™s organisational capabilities.

## Core Features
1. Add and delete internship entries
2. Keep track of internship status
3. Associate tags with each internship
4. Search internships by names, roles and tags
5. Saving of internship entries to a local data file (auto-saving included!)

## Getting Started
