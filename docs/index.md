**InternBuddy is a desktop application for Computing undergraduates to manage and track their internship applications.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using InternBuddy, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t14-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing InternBuddy, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t14-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
