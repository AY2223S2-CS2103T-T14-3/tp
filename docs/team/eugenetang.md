## About InternBuddy

InternBuddy is a one-stop and simple platform for **Computing undergraduates** to manage and keep track of their
internship applications. It is a desktop application that is optimised for **fast typists** where interactions
primarily revolve around text input, although it does provide a graphical user interface for users.

Implementation-wise, InternBuddy is created using **Java 11**, with usage of the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/),
[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) and [JUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5) libraries. It
is adapted from the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
