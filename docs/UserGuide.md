InternBuddy is a **desktop app for Computing undergraduate students to manage their internship applications**. It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InternBuddy can efficiently track your internship applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `addressbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : List All Internship Entries.

   * `add n/CompanyXYZ r/Software engineering intern s/applied d/2023-03-03` : Adds an entry to track the internship application for Company XYZ for a software engineering role.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd internship entry shown in the current list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Apple`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `edit INDEX [n/NAME]` can be used as `edit 2 n/CompanyXYZ` or as `edit 2`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/Apple r/Software Engineer`, `r/Software Engineer n/Apple` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For any parameters that refer to a date (such as `add`, `edit`), they must be specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `edit INDEX [d/DATE]`, then 1 March 2023 should be entered as `2023-03-01` for the parameter `DATE`.

### Adding an internship entry: `add`

Adds a new internship entry to the list of existing entries.

Format: `add n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE s/STATUS d/DATE`
- The `STATUS` field  must have one of the following values: `new`, `applied`,
  `assessment`, `interview`, `offered` or `rejected`.
- The meaning of `DATE` would be interpreted with respect to the value of `STATUS`.


| Status       | Interpretation of Date       |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| `new`        | Deadline of Application      |
| `applied`    | Date of Application          |
| `assessment` | Date of Technical Assessment |
| `interview`  | Date of Behavioral Interview |
| `offered`    | Date of Offer                |
| `rejected`   | Date of Rejection            |

Examples:
* `add n/Apple r/Software Engineer s/new d/2023-02-01` Adds a new internship entry with
  company name `Apple`, role `Software Engineer`, status `new` and deadline
  of application `2023-02-01`.
* `add n/Amazon r/Cloud Architect s/assessment d/2023-02-01` Adds a new internship entry
  with company name `Amazon`, role `Cloud Architect`, status `assessment` and
  date of technical assessment `2023-02-01`.
* `add n/Facebook s/new d/2023-02-01` Displays an error because the role is missing.

### Listing all internship entries : `list`

Shows a list of all internship entries that have been added into InternBuddy.

Format: `list`

### Editing an internship entry : `edit`

Edits an internship entry from the list of existing entries.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/COMPANY_NAME] [r/ROLE] [s/STATUS ] [d/DATE]`

* The internship entry whose entry number is `INDEX` would be updated. `INDEX` needs to be a valid entry number as specified in the internship list displayed using the`list` command. 
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* `STATUS` must have one of the following values: `new`, `applied`, `assessment`, `interview`, `offered` or `rejected`.

Examples:
*  `edit 2 s/assessment r/Software Developer` Sets the status and role of the second internship entry as `assessment` and `Software Developer` respectively.
*  `edit 2` Displays an error because the command does not satisfy the criteria of having at least one optional field.

### Deleting an internship entry : `delete`

Deletes the specified internship entry from InternBuddy.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the internship entry at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed internship entries list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Example:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd internship entry in InternBuddy.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`
